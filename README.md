### Path
1. Read and understand the problem.
2. Consider edge cases in the problem.
3. Write brute force (dummy) code to solve the problem.
4. Try to optimise the code based on experience.
5. Look at other solutions and find better solutions.
6. Learn from other solutions and take notes down.
7. Write down solution and thinkings in simple words.
